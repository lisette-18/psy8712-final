Dataset: The project uses the 2004 GSS dataset to explore empathy and prosocial behaviors with demographics as moderators. The demographic moderators include age, sex, race, political party identification, and strength of connection to religion/spirituality

Project Description: This dataset tests the following three questions: 1) Is there a correlation between one’s reported empathy towards others and there reported prosocial behavior?, 2) Do demographic variables moderate people’s reported empathy toward others and enacted prosocial behavior?, and 3) Can empathy and demographic variables be used to predict enacted prosocial behavior utilizing machine learning models?
